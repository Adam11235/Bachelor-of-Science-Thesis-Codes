This project implements a Machine Learning system to predict steel strength properties (Yield Strength, Tensile Strength, Elongation) solely based on chemical composition, eliminating the need for destructive laboratory testing. The system includes a Python-based prediction engine and a physical IoT device (ESP32) for result visualization.
